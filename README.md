# SkillUpdater
MistySpecific: As many end points used in a skill have changed, I created a script that auto updates your current skills ! Dated: 29 March 2019 !

## To use:
Place the update.py in the directory that contains the .js files and run thee script. It will create the updated_skill.js files. 

Feel free to update the script to scan multiple direcetories or take arguments , auto rename the files created !! Lots more to do to make much easier.
